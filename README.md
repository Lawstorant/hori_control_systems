# This is a Experimental Linux Kernel driver for the Hori Truck Control System.

All three pedals works now, Gas, brake and clutch.
The hat switch (d-Pad on the left side) and Force Feedback are not working yet.

Button 5 can't use as return or left mouse button, because the button is not mapped as left mouse button/return key.
The steering wheel behaves the same as under Windows. The left analog stick can now be used as a mouse.
The dead zone has also been resolved.

The shifter is full working now, but it's displayed twice.

This kernel driver is early alpha.

**I cannot be held responsible for any damage to the device. The use of this driver is at your own risk**
